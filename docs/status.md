## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Firebase Integration ðŸš§
1. Implement Firebase Authentication
2. Add Firestore CRUD operations
3. Connect sitemap crawler to Firestore
4. Implement screenshot upload to Storage

### Phase 3: Realtime Collaboration ðŸš§
1. Add Firestore listeners
2. Implement presence tracking
3. Handle concurrent updates

### Phase 4: Enhancement ðŸš§
1. Auto-layout algorithms
2. Export functionality
3. Advanced features

## Project Overview

**Visual Sitemap Explorer** - A tool that takes a website sitemap (e.g. WordPress XML), loads each page, and visualizes the site as a zoomable, draggable graph with realtime collaboration.

### Key Features
- **Sitemap Import**: Parse WordPress XML sitemap and store pages in Firestore as nodes
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Puppeteer script to generate screenshots and upload to Firebase Storage
- **Graph Rendering**: React Flow with custom nodes (`IframeNode`) - show thumbnail by default, iframe on click
- **Realtime Collaboration**: Firestore sync for nodes + edges with realtime updates on drag/drop, toggles
- **Deployment**: Firebase Hosting with optional Firebase Auth for multi-user projects

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: React + React Flow
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Storage, Auth, Hosting)
- Scripts: Node.js (Puppeteer + fast-xml-parser)

## Development Phases

1. **Phase 1: Core Setup** - React app + Firebase configuration
2. **Phase 2: Sitemap Import** - XML parsing + Firestore integration
3. **Phase 3: Thumbnail Capture** - Puppeteer + Firebase Storage
4. **Phase 4: Graph Rendering** - React Flow + custom nodes
5. **Phase 5: Realtime Collaboration** - Firestore sync + presence
6. **Phase 6: Hosting + Auth** - Deployment + user management

## Recent Updates (Latest)

### Screenshot API Fixed âœ…
- Removed hard Puppeteer dependency (was causing module errors)
- Implemented multi-tier screenshot generation:
  1. Screenshot API service (production-ready, works in serverless)
  2. Puppeteer fallback (local development)
  3. Placeholder fallback (always works)
- Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/screenshot-api.md`
- Updated README with environment variable setup

### Known Issues
- Firebase configuration required (`.env.local` needs Firebase credentials)
- Screenshot API key optional for production (uses placeholder without it)

## Notes

- All documentation is in place and ready for development
- Task breakdown is comprehensive and organized by phases
- Architecture is designed for scalability and realtime collaboration
- Screenshot functionality works in all environments (local, serverless, production)
