# Visual Sitemap Explorer - Project Status

## Current Status: âœ… Project-Based Sitemap Visualization Implemented

The Atlas project now supports a project-based workflow where each domain becomes a project. Users can input a domain, Atlas automatically checks for sitemap.xml, parses the sitemap, and creates an interactive visual diagram of all pages.

## Completed Items

- [x] Firebase SDK setup in `src/lib/firebase.ts`
- [x] React Flow integrated with custom nodes
- [x] ESLint and Prettier configured
- [x] Vercel deployment configuration

### UI Components âœ…
- [x] Homepage with hero section
- [x] Canvas page with React Flow demo
- [x] Dashboard with project list
- [x] Auth page with Google/Email UI
- [x] Custom IframeNode component with thumbnail/iframe toggle
- [x] Responsive layouts with Tailwind

### Scripts âœ…
- [x] `crawl-sitemap.js` - XML sitemap parser
- [x] `screenshot-upload.js` - Puppeteer screenshot generator

### API Routes âœ…
- [x] `/api/screenshot` - Screenshot generation with multi-tier fallback
  - Production: Screenshot API (ScreenshotOne)
  - Development: Puppeteer (local)
  - Fallback: Placeholder images

### Documentation âœ…
- [x] README.md updated with environment variables
- [x] SETUP.md created
- [x] DEPLOYMENT.md created
- [x] project.md comprehensive guide
- [x] docs/screenshot-api.md - Screenshot implementation guide
- [x] All technical docs updated

### Phase 2: Project-Based Sitemap Import âœ…
- [x] `/api/sitemap` - Fetch and parse sitemap.xml from domain
- [x] `/api/projects/create` - Create project with sitemap data
- [x] CreateProjectModal component - UI for creating projects
- [x] Dashboard - List projects with realtime updates
- [x] Canvas - Display project's sitemap as interactive diagram
- [x] Automatic sitemap detection (tries multiple common paths)
- [x] Realtime node syncing via Firestore
- [x] Project subcollections for nodes (`projects/{projectId}/nodes`)
- [x] **Nested Sitemap Support** - Recursively fetches and parses sitemap indexes
  - Automatically detects sitemap indexes
  - Fetches all sub-sitemaps in parallel (up to 50)
  - Supports up to 3 levels of nesting
  - Aggregates all URLs from all sitemaps
  - Handles up to 500 nodes per project

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Screenshot Generation ðŸš§
1. Integrate screenshot API for node thumbnails
2. Generate thumbnails for sitemap URLs
3. Display thumbnails in nodes

### Phase 4: Firebase Authentication ðŸš§
1. Implement Firebase Auth
2. Add user-based project ownership
3. Add project sharing/permissions

### Phase 5: Advanced Features ðŸš§
1. Auto-layout algorithms (hierarchical, grid)
2. Export functionality (PNG, PDF)
3. Page metadata extraction
4. Search and filter

## Project Overview

**Visual Sitemap Explorer** - A tool that takes a website sitemap (e.g. WordPress XML), loads each page, and visualizes the site as a zoomable, draggable graph with realtime collaboration.

### Key Features
- **Sitemap Import**: Parse WordPress XML sitemap and store pages in Firestore as nodes
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Puppeteer script to generate screenshots and upload to Firebase Storage
- **Graph Rendering**: React Flow with custom nodes (`IframeNode`) - show thumbnail by default, iframe on click
- **Realtime Collaboration**: Firestore sync for nodes + edges with realtime updates on drag/drop, toggles
- **Deployment**: Firebase Hosting with optional Firebase Auth for multi-user projects

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: React + React Flow
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Storage, Auth, Hosting)
- Scripts: Node.js (Puppeteer + fast-xml-parser)

## Development Phases

1. **Phase 1: Core Setup** - React app + Firebase configuration
2. **Phase 2: Sitemap Import** - XML parsing + Firestore integration
3. **Phase 3: Thumbnail Capture** - Puppeteer + Firebase Storage
4. **Phase 4: Graph Rendering** - React Flow + custom nodes
5. **Phase 5: Realtime Collaboration** - Firestore sync + presence
6. **Phase 6: Hosting + Auth** - Deployment + user management

## Recent Updates (Latest)

### Screenshot API Fixed âœ…
- Removed hard Puppeteer dependency (was causing module errors)
- Implemented multi-tier screenshot generation:
  1. Screenshot API service (production-ready, works in serverless)
  2. Puppeteer fallback (local development)
  3. Placeholder fallback (always works)
- Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/screenshot-api.md`
- Updated README with environment variable setup

### Known Issues
- Firebase configuration required (`.env.local` needs Firebase credentials)
- Screenshot API key optional for production (uses placeholder without it)

## Notes

- All documentation is in place and ready for development
- Task breakdown is comprehensive and organized by phases
- Architecture is designed for scalability and realtime collaboration
- Screenshot functionality works in all environments (local, serverless, production)
