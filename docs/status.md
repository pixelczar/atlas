# Visual Sitemap Explorer - Project Status

## Current Status: âœ… Advanced Sitemap Visualization with Hierarchical Layouts

The Atlas project now supports a comprehensive project-based workflow with advanced visualization features. Users can input a domain, Atlas automatically checks for sitemap.xml, parses the sitemap, and creates an interactive visual diagram with multiple layout algorithms, search functionality, and real-time collaboration.

5. Version history and snapshots

## Project Overview

**Visual Sitemap Explorer** - A tool that takes a website sitemap (e.g. WordPress XML), loads each page, and visualizes the site as a zoomable, draggable graph with realtime collaboration.

### Key Features
- **Sitemap Import**: Parse WordPress XML sitemap and store pages in Firestore as nodes
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Puppeteer script to generate screenshots and upload to Firebase Storage
- **Graph Rendering**: React Flow with custom nodes (`IframeNode`) - show thumbnail by default, iframe on click
- **Realtime Collaboration**: Firestore sync for nodes + edges with realtime updates on drag/drop, toggles
- **Deployment**: Firebase Hosting with optional Firebase Auth for multi-user projects

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: React + React Flow
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Storage, Auth, Hosting)
- Scripts: Node.js (Puppeteer + fast-xml-parser)

## Development Phases

1. **Phase 1: Core Setup** - React app + Firebase configuration
2. **Phase 2: Sitemap Import** - XML parsing + Firestore integration
3. **Phase 3: Thumbnail Capture** - Puppeteer + Firebase Storage
4. **Phase 4: Graph Rendering** - React Flow + custom nodes
5. **Phase 5: Realtime Collaboration** - Firestore sync + presence
6. **Phase 6: Hosting + Auth** - Deployment + user management

## Recent Updates (Latest)

### Advanced Layout & Visualization System âœ…
- **Hierarchical Layout Algorithms**: Implemented Tree and Dagre layouts with proper URL-based hierarchy
- **Sibling Clustering**: Fixed spacing issues to keep related pages grouped together
- **Auto-Center on Home**: Graph automatically centers on the home page when loading
- **Curved Edges**: Replaced straight lines with smooth, curved connections
- **Layout Switching**: Real-time switching between Grid, Tree, and Dagre layouts
- **Responsive Spacing**: Optimized vertical and horizontal spacing for better readability

### Enhanced User Interface âœ…
- **Project Sidebar**: Left slide-out panel with all projects and management options
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Interactive navigation showing project > sitemap > pages hierarchy
- **Search & Filter**: Real-time search with highlighting and page visibility toggles
- **Floating Controls**: Island-style floating UI for layout controls and actions
- **Selection Toolbar**: Contextual actions when nodes are selected
- **Loading Animations**: Custom SVG-based loading animations

### User Experience Improvements âœ…
- **Compact Design**: Reduced padding, smaller fonts, refined spacing throughout
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion transitions and micro-interactions
- **Mouse Wheel Zoom**: Default zoom behavior without modifier keys
- **Node Persistence**: Dragged nodes maintain their positions
- **Visual Feedback**: Enhanced hover effects, selection states, and search highlighting

### Screenshot API Fixed âœ…
- Removed hard Puppeteer dependency (was causing module errors)
- Implemented multi-tier screenshot generation:
  1. Screenshot API service (production-ready, works in serverless)
  2. Puppeteer fallback (local development)
  3. Placeholder fallback (always works)
- Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/screenshot-api.md`
- Updated README with environment variable setup

### Known Issues
- Firebase configuration required (`.env.local` needs Firebase credentials)
- Screenshot API key optional for production (uses placeholder without it)

## Notes

- All documentation is in place and ready for development
- Task breakdown is comprehensive and organized by phases
- Architecture is designed for scalability and realtime collaboration
- Screenshot functionality works in all environments (local, serverless, production)
